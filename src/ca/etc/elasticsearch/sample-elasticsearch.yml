# This configuration was intended for Elasticsearch version 8.3.2

# You should review these settings, and then update the main configuration file at
#   /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
#

# This turns on SSL for the HTTP (Rest) interface
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true

# This configures the keystore to use for SSL on HTTP
# Because your keystore has a password, you will also need to add the password to the Elasticsearch keystore

xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: "http.p12"
